- So many sensors, and so much longitudinal data
- Validity: _How do we know we're using the best models?_

### Human beings also have many cycles

::: incremental
-   Steps
-   Hormonal cycles
-   Circadian rhythm
-   Time spent on different **activities**
    -   Annual "return to gym"
    -   \% of time indoors vs outdoors
    -   Amount of time spent driving
    -   More examples?

-   Unstable cycles predict poorer health outcomes.

- We know this from diarised self-reports of activity.

-   It's important to make sure we're using *appropriate* models to capture activity

-   "All models are wrong, but some are useful."

## Study Objectives

::: callout-note
## The "Gap"

> Despite the potential of mHealth data, statistical models that
> translate these data into interpretable measures of diurnal rhythms
> and markers to manage mental health are \[still\] an active area of
> research
:::

1.  "...use smartphone sensors and activity data to quantify... \[a\]
    participant's activity rhythm..."

2.  "to test for...associations between demographic variables and mood
    outcomes, and the strength of activity rhythm or routine"

## Data Processing {background-color="black" background-image="https://c.tenor.com/lL_Ream6doIAAAAd/pfsf1968-shovelling-snow.gif"}

### Data Processing

Raw accelerometer data was binned into hours and averaged:

```{r}
tribble(
  ~participant, ~Accel_X, ~Accel_Y, ~Accel_Z, ~Time,
  "A", 3.0, 10.5, 23.4, "13:21",
  "A", 5.0, 9.5, 25.4, "13:54",
  "A", 5.0, 9.5, 25.4, "14:01",
  "B", 3.7, 10.5, 23.4, "08:58",
  "B", 9.4, 6.3, 10.4, "09:00",
  "B", 2.4, 11.5, 3.5, "09:01",
) %>%
  gt()
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Data Processing

Raw accelerometer data was binned into hours and averaged:

```{r}
tribble(
  ~participant, ~mean_Acceleration, ~Hour_Window,
  "A", 10.5, "14:00",
  "A", 9.5, "15:00",
  "B", 5.5, "09:00",
  "B", 6.3,"10:00"
) %>%
  gt()
```

(Screen on-off events were similarly binned and _summed_)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Data Processing: Imputation

::: incremental
-   Accelerometer data can be missing for many reasons (power on/off,
    signal, airplane mode, erratic participant behavior)

-   Assumptions:

    -   Missing accelerometer data, and it's night time when you usually
        *don't* -\> "dormancy"
    -   Missing accelerometer data, and it's a time that you usually
        *do* -\> "missing data" that should be imputed
    -   Missing accelerometer data, but you have no screen on-off events
        -\> "dormancy"

-   Used a Hidden Markov Model to impute this data

### Data Processing: Imputation

![WTH is a Markov
Chain?](https://miro.medium.com/max/1032/1*jcbUF7dAhAIRS8nfUlNtow.gif)

e.g. Signals controlling a gate, healthy vs. unhealthy behavior, flow of
language.

It's all about **probabilities of changing states.**

### Developing the "Activity Rhythm Metric" with Markov Chains

-   Used "continuous time Hidden Markov Model" to define high activity
    vs low activity
-   Incorporates mixed modeling to account for the effect of the hour of
    day on the *likelihood* of rest vs. activity

## Takeaways?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: callout-tip
### Mixed Models + Markov Chains Allow You to Consider Repeating Patterns

> if a person tends to be active or at rest during the same hours of the
> day routinely, then the restful hours will have very low random
> intercepts, with active hours having high random intercepts

By accounting for these mixed effects, they hope to get a better idea of
activity *rhythms* (ARM) measured by accelerometer *and* screen events,
moderated by the likelihood of changing activity

## Conclusions

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
::: incremental
-   "Regularity of routine" (ARM) quantified using accelerometer and screen on-off
-   CT-HMM modeled ARM accounting for the "hour-of-the-day effect"
-   ARM associated with sleep, mood _self-report_
- Limited sample size --> non-significant p-values
:::
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
::: incremental
-   ARM associated with demographics, but not sleep, mood _inventories_

-   Reflects that diarised methods associated with sleep quality and demographics
- ARM _only_ accounts for activity

## Discussion

- Diarised methods?
  - Social Rhythm Metric ([SRM](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2299336/))

- Sample sizes?

- Modeling for inference vs. prediction?
